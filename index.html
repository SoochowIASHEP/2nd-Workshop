	<h4 style="margin-top: 30pt;"> Introduction </h4>

<p class="p2" style="margin-top:-10pt;">		
The detection of gravitational waves opens a window towards understanding the data of the universe. Nowadays, more techniques from string theory, quantum field theory
has been applied to study black hole quasinormal modes, which are important to understand the gravitational wave data.
This connection also enables us to apply possibly the idea of holography into studying the relevant topics.
Many progress has been made to understand the dual gravitational theory from the field theory techniques. 
The idea of this workshop is to bring people working in various fields together to share the most recent opinion and hopefully make it productive. </p>

<p class="p2">	 	
This workshop is aimed towards advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and active researchers in the field. 
We encourage students from all over the world to participate, and for domestic students we will try our best to provide financial supports to attend the workshop in person. 
</p>

<p class="p2">	 
The workshop will be held from October 14th to October 19th, 2024. 
</p>

<p class="p2">	 The 2024 Soochow workshop in High energy physics is generously supported by Graduate School of Soochow University (苏州大学研究生院) and by the funds of Kosterlitz office in China (苏州外籍院士工作站).</p>

<p class="p2">	  The event will be hosted by School of Physical Science and Technology and Institute for Advanced Study of Soochow University. The Institute for Advanced Study of Soochow University (SUIAS) is a newly founded research center with the long-term goal in fostering a creative research platform from which young scholars can grow as future academic and technological leaders of China. 
Prof. John Michael Kosterlitz works as the Honorary Dean of the institute.
